Deep Dive into Active Patterns
===

This repository provides a concise, but thorough, review of one of F#'s more-powerful features -- Active Patterns! This feature allows one to extend the pattern-matching capabilities of the language. Active patterns help improve a declarative style of coding. And are critical for tasks such as: integrating procedural APIs, constructing embedded DSLs, and much more. The session first tours the "breathe" of the feature. Then follows a discussion of the underlying mechanics. Finally, a few different "worked examples" are reviewed in-depth. Attendees are encouraged to pose questions throughout, but they will only be answered at the conclusion of the presentation. This talk is aimed at advanced beginners who are familiar with F#â€™s general syntax and usage.
